    <h2>Jade Grant</h2>
    <p>Hello! My name is Jade Grant. I live in Idaho but grew up in Wyoming. I am currently doing BYU Pathways to learn a bit about coding but then I am planning on going to BYUI on campus to major in Computer Science. 
        I greatly enjoy programming, whether that finding out how it works, making the program, or fixing an error. I also enjoy doing other type of technical things from working on a computer to fixing a computer.</p>
    <p>I have been a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints for all of my life. I greatly love the gospel and learning more about it. It has changed and blessed my life in many great ways for which I will forever be grateful for.</p>
    <p>I enjoy reading. I mainly read fantasy because I enjoy the sense of adventure that many of the stories bring. My favorite author is Brandon Sanderson and he should also the favorite author for everyone else who enjoys fantasy, no exceptions.</p>
    <p>I hope to greatly enjoy this class and also to get to know a few of you during our time together. I hope you all have a great semester.</p>
