            <p>● Make sure our thermostat is set to cool.</p>

        <h3>Buy a New Air Filter</h3>
            <p>Another issue could be that the air filter is dirty, this is actually more common than you would think. A dirty air filter can cause many problems. It restricts air from flowing, preventing the system from cool down your house which will in turn cause your air conditioner to overwork and increasing your heating bill.</p> 
            <p>On the other hand, it is important to have a filter. It not only keeps the air clean but also keeps the inside of the blower housing clean from dust. Dust in a blower housing could lead to future problem and cause more issues to the preformance of the air. The optimal time for replacing your air filter is at least once every three months.</p>
        <h3>Look at the Condensate Pan/Pump</h3>
        <p>All air conditioner produce condensation when operating. The AC will have a condensate pan and drain. The drain is usually a small PVC pipe. Find the drain and make sure that it is not clogged.</p>
        <h4>If doing all these things don't help fix the issue then please call us to set an appointment.</h4>
