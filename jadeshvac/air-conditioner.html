        <h4>Buy a New Air Filter</h4>
        <p>
    Another issue could be that the air filter is dirty, this is actually more common than you would think. A dirty air filter can cause many problems. It restricts air from flowing, preventing your house from cooling down which in turn will cause your air conditioner to overwork and increasing your heating bill. On the other hand, it is important to have a filter. It not only keeps your air clean but also keeps the inside of your equipment clean from dust. Dust in a blower housing can then lead to further issues to the preformance of your system. 
    The optimal time for replacing your air filter is at least once every three months.
        </p>

        <h4>Look at the Condensate Pan/Pump</h4>
        <p>
            All air conditioner produce condensation when operating. The AC will have a condensate pan and drain. The drain is usually a small PVC pipe. Find the drain and make sure that it is not clogged.
        </p>
