      <h2>Furnace</h2>
        <h3>Repairs</h3> 
        <h3>Thing you can check before having your furnace serviced</h3>
        <p>Thermostat.</p>
        <p1>1) Check to be sure the batteries are still good.
        2) Make sure our thermostat is set to “heat”.
        3) If it is programable then ensure it is set to the correct day.
        4) None of this works the furnace could be without power. </p1>
        <p>Breakers and Switches.</p>
        <p1> 1) Check the breaker on the electrical panel in our house to make sure it has not been flipped. The breaker should be labeled as furnace or heat. 
        2) If off then flip the break on, if the breaker trips instantly don't try to reset it but contact us right away as it can be hazardous.  </p1>
        <p>Buy a New Air Filter.</p>
        <p1>Another issue could be that the air filter is dirty, this is actually more common than you would think. A dirty air filter can cause many problems. It restricts air from flowing, preventing your house from warming up which in turn will cause your furnace to overwork and increasing your heating bill. 
        On the other hand, it is important to have a filter. It not only keeps your air clean but also keeps the inside of your furnace clean from dust. Dust in a furnace can then lead to further issues to the preforms of your furnace. 
        The optimal time for replacing your air filter is at least once every three months. </p1>
        <p>Look at the Condensate Pan or the condensate pump.</p>
        <p1>Many furnaces produce condensation when operating. If your furnace has a condensate drain (it will be a small PVC pipe) then make sure it is not clogged. </p1>
        <p>Light the Pilot Light.</p>
        <p1>If the furnace is old then it could have a pilot light that needs to be lit. Look on the furnace to find instructs to relight the pilot. Note: Many newer furnaces do not use a pilot light.  </p1>

        <h3>If you need a new furnace then we also do installations.</h3>

      <h3>Installation</h3> 
        <p>Why get a replacement? </p>
        <p1> 1) The furnace could be old and is currently running the risk of failure, replace it before it fails on you. 
        2) Old Furnaces are usually less efficient which in turns increases the cost to run it.
