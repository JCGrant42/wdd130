    <p>
    Before you call us there
are some things you can do first. If none of these things work then
please call us and we will send
some one over at the earliest
convenience.
    </p>
    <h4>Thermostat</h4>
    <p>
1) Check to be sure the batteries are still good. 
2) Make sure our thermostat is set to “heat”. 
3) If it is programable then ensure it is set to the correct day. 
4) None of this works the furnace could be without power.
    </p>

    <h4>Breakers and Switches</h4>
    <p>
1) Check the breaker on the electrical panel in our house to make sure it has not been flipped. The breaker should be labeled as furnace or heat. 
2) If off then flip the break on, if the breaker trips instantly don't try to reset it but contact us right away as it can be hazardous.
    </p>
    <h4>Buy a New Air Filter</h4>
    <p>
Another issue could be that the air filter is dirty, this is actually more common than you would think. A dirty air filter can cause many problems. It restricts air from flowing, preventing your house from warming up which in turn will cause your furnace to overwork and increasing your heating bill. On the other hand, it is important to have a filter. It not only keeps your air clean but also keeps the inside of your furnace clean from dust. Dust in a furnace can then lead to further issues to the preformance of your furnace. The optimal time for replacing your air filter is at least once every three months.
    </p>

    <h4>Look at the Condensate Pan/Pump</h4>
    <p>
        Many furnaces produce condensation when operating. If your furnace has a condensate drain (it will be a small PVC pipe) then make sure it is not clogged. If it is clogged try to unclog it and see if it fixes the issue.
    </p>
    <h4>Check Pilot Light</h4>
    <p>
        If the furnace is old then it could have a pilot light that needs to be lit. Look on the furnace to find instructs to relight the pilot. Note: Many newer furnaces do not use a pilot light.
    </p>
    <p>If doing all of these things doesn't fix
        the problem then please call us now
        to set an appointment.

        If for what ever reason your furnace
can not be repaired or if it is simply
old and you would prefer a new one
then we would love to help you by
installing a completely new one.

    <h2>Installation</h2>
    <h3>Why Get a New Furnace?</h3>
